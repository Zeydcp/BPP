# Beautiful Program Proofs

The main focus is the Assets folder which contains all the project files I worked on. Particularly Assets/Scripts which has all the scripts I wrote in C# using a .NET framework.

To install the game on Windows 64-bit navigate to Build/Windows/Installer and download BPP Setup.exe, then run the executable.

## Controls for game:
- Navigation: →, ←, ↑, ↓ keys represent movement along x-z plane, W and S keys represent up and down movement respectively in y-axis.
- Block placing: ␣ key while aiming at the roof or another block will place an object
- Interacting with block: T key while aiming at a block
Commands that you can input:
- alphabeticstring := malloc(anyint)
- [alphabeticstring] := anyfloat
- [alphabeticstring]++
- free(alphabeticstring)
- swap

- swap must be inputted into two blocks with same y-z values or one double-sized block.
- Toggle between design and generate mode using G-key, design mode lets you input the first four commands, swaps are done automatically,
- design mode has an extra command: alphabeticstring -> anyfloat
